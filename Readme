Program for solving Problem 1 (Partition the n integers into n/2 pairs) :
Program for solving Problem 2 (Divide the n integers into n/log n groups of log n
master file is for problem1 and master2 is for problem2

Both programs compile with make command 
executed the following way:
   For the first program 
   $ ./master data_100.txt

for the second program we use
$ ./master2 data_1000.txt

we can check the results in adder_log.txt file

Methods Comparison :-
It took more time for method 1 than method 2.

version control:-
